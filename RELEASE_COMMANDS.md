## 4. Alternative: Manual GitHub Release

If you don't have `gh` CLI installed, you can create the release manually:

1. Go to https://github.com/deephouse23/weather-cli/releases
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Tag version: `v0.0.2`
4. Release title: `v0.0.2 - Simplified Global Installation`
5. Copy the release notes from the `gh release create` command above
6. Check "Set as the latest release"
7. Click "Publish release"

## 5. Verify Release

```bash
# Verify the tag was created
git tag -l

# Verify remote has the tag
git ls-remote --tags origin

# Check GitHub release page
echo "Visit: https://github.com/deephouse23/weather-cli/releases/tag/v0.0.2"
```

## 6. Test Installation from Release

To test that users can install from the release:

```bash
# Test cloning and installing
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/deephouse23/weather-cli.git weather-cli-test
cd weather-cli-test
git checkout v0.0.2
npm install && npm install -g .
weather --version  # Should show 0.0.2
```

## Notes

- All commands assume you're in the weather-cli directory
- Make sure you have push permissions to the repository
- The `gh` CLI tool needs to be authenticated with GitHub
- Users will be able to install this version with the simplified commands immediately after the release
