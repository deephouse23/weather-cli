## [0.2.24] - 2025-01-07

### üé® **Added**
- **Horizontal layout** with responsive design that adapts to terminal width
- **City, State format requirement** for better location accuracy
- **Enhanced location display** with city name in cyan and state/country in yellow
- **Modular architecture** split from 920-line file into 4 focused modules
- **Enhanced caching system** with 30-minute expiration and cleanup tools
- **Responsive design** with three layout modes (compact, medium, full)
- **Visual improvements** with emojis and better color coding
- **Cache management commands** with statistics and cleanup options
- **Security enhancements** with proper .env management and API key protection
- **Better error handling** with informative messages and validation

### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Changes**
- **Split monolithic file** into modular structure:
  - `src/weather.js` - API calls and weather logic
  - `src/cache.js` - Caching with expiration
  - `src/display.js` - UI formatting and output
  - `src/config.js` - Configuration management
- **Enhanced caching** with automatic expiration and cleanup
- **Improved error handling** with secure error messages
- **Better validation** for location format requirements

### üîí **Security**
- **Fixed .env file tracking** - Removed from git to prevent API key exposure
- **Updated dependencies** - Fixed security vulnerabilities in inquirer
- **Secure error messages** - No API key exposure in error output
- **Proper .gitignore** - Ensures sensitive files stay local
- **Clean documentation** - Removed API keys from documentation

### üéØ **Breaking Changes**
- **Required format change**: Now requires `"City, State"` or `"City, Country"` format
- **Old format no longer works**: `weather "London"` now requires `weather "London, UK"`
- **Enhanced validation**: Clear error messages when format is incorrect

### üìä **Performance**
- **Reduced API calls** through intelligent caching
- **Better cache management** with automatic expiration
- **Improved response times** with cache hit optimization
- **Memory optimization** with proper cleanup of expired entries

### üß™ **Testing**
- **Added test files** for modules, basic functionality, and responsive design
- **Performance testing** with benchmarks and metrics
- **Security testing** with API key validation checks
- **Module testing** for all new modular components

### üìö **Documentation**
- **Updated README** with new features and requirements
- **Added comprehensive examples** for all new features
- **Security documentation** with best practices
- **Installation guides** for different use cases
